                <h1 class="hiNoSpace">Me</h1>
                <p>Hi, I'm <strong>Marco Astorga</strong>, a father of two children. I'm from Chile, and I've been
                    living in Kitchener, Canada, for one year and six months. My native language is Spanish. In my
                    spare
                    time, I spend playing Minecraft<img id="minecraftIcon" src="images/minecraft.gif" alt="IconGifMInecraft"> or learning about cars and I am also a YouTuber where I tell
                    about
                    my life.</p>


                <h1 class="hiNoSpace">Work Experience</h1>
                <p>I have been a <strong>Software Engineer</strong> for almost three years, and I have worked in two
                    companies about
                    technology during these years. In the first company, I worked as a Backend developer in Java and
                    later, I entered my current job where I joined as a backend developer in technology such as Java
                    and
                    NestJS, but now I am in the support area as a technical leader in various technologies such as
                    Docker, Kubernetes in cloud environments, Java, Nestjs in backend and in frontend technologies
                    such
                    as VueJS, Angular among others, where every day I have to learn new technologies because every
                    day I
                    I face a different challenge where we have to solve different types of problems with various
                    technologies.</p>


                <h1 class="hiNoSpace">Chile</h1>
                <div id="container1">
                    <p>It is a small country, but very long. It has different climates throughout the
                        country with deserts,
                        forests, fields and frozen places.
                        Well, it is a country that is located at the end of the world, we are from Argentina, Peru
                        and
                        Bolivia, in Chile there are lovely places like the Atacama desert, a special place to see
                        the stars,
                        in Santiago is the capital of Chile where In a few hours there are places with lots of
                        fields and
                        beaches, further to the south you will find sites with many lakes and beaches and further to
                        the
                        south you will find the North Pole where you can see penguins, there are more beautiful
                        things in
                        that country, but They are the ones that I love the most in my experience.</p>

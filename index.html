                    <h1 id="title">Work Experience</h1>
                    <p>I have worked as a software engineer for two technology companies, starting as a Backend
                        Developer where I honed my skills in Java. In my current role as a Technical Leader, I have
                        expanded my expertise to include technologies such as <strong>Docker</strong>, <strong>Kubernetes</strong>, and <strong>NestJS</strong> in cloud
                        environments. Additionally, I have gained experience in frontend technologies such as <strong>VueJS</strong> and
                        <strong>Angular</strong>. </p>
                    <p>My experience has taught me the importance of being able to quickly adapt to new technologies and
                        finding innovative solutions to complex problems. I am constantly learning and facing new
                        challenges, which has allowed me to develop a wide range of skills and become proficient in
                        various technologies. </p>
                    <h1 id="title">Other Works</h1>
                    <p>In addition to my professional work experience, I am also actively involved in several side
                        projects. These projects give me the opportunity to experiment with new technologies and further
                        develop my skills. Some examples of these projects include developing a personal portfolio
                        website and contributing to open-source projects. </p>
                    <p>My side projects have allowed me to gain experience in technologies such as <strong>React</strong>, <strong>VueJS</strong>, and
                        <strong>Angular</strong>. I have also gained experience in cloud environments such as <strong>Azure</strong> and <strong>AWS</strong>. </p>

                            to improve my skills and abilities. I believe that being smart is not just about having a
                            high IQ, but also about having a strong work ethic, being able to solve problems creatively,
                            and always striving for self-improvement.</p>

                    <h1 id="title">NestJS and Angular </h1>
                    <p>One of my proudest accomplishments as a software developer was the creation of the website <a class="nostyleurl" href="https://teemfamily.com" target="_blank"><strong>teemfamily.com</strong></a>. For this project, I utilized <strong>Angular</strong> as the frontend framework and <strong>NestJS</strong> as the backend framework. The choice to use these technologies was based on several factors, including their ease of use and scalability. <strong>Angular</strong> provided a seamless experience for building dynamic user interfaces, while <strong>NestJS</strong> allowed for the creation of robust and scalable server-side applications. The result was a smooth and responsive website that was able to handle a large amount of traffic. Working on this project allowed me to further develop my skills in both <strong>Angular</strong> and <strong>NestJS</strong> and I am confident in my ability to continue using these technologies in future projects.</p>
